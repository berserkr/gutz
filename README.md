# Gutz Blockchain Whitepaper

## Introduction

This whitepaper is looking to explore the feasibility of a Quantum-proof blockchain fabric capable of generating proofs of smart contract execution without fully trusting the underlying fabric. The aim is to then implement this higher-level concept in one of the many blockchain fabrics available as the concept is more-or-less blockchain agnostic.

## About Gutz Decentralized

Gutz Decentralized focuses on providing secure decentralized solutions. With years of experience in blockchain solutions development in industry, the lead developers decided to venture on their own to work on their concepts. The intent is not to re-invent the wheel, rather, develop core technology that will leverage the best of what is already in the market. 

## Gutz Blockchain

The Gutz Blockchain is fabric agnostic, meaning, that the core concepts could be implemented in any of the turin-complete blockchain solutions in the market (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, etc.). For the time being, we have decided to fork Ethereum and augment it with some of our technology. Like all true decentralized technology, we too want to make sure anything we do is transparent, and our users can have full confidence in what we are doing. Our work is
fully open source and free to use by all. 

## Gutz Enterprise Services

We do provide consulting as well as development services.
